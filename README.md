# Robota

Built at TechCrunch Disrupt New York 2017

## Brief description
The robot's camera recognizes looks for and recognizes a face, prompts for speech, transcribes, analyzes for sentiment, and notifies the teacher.

It is not properly configured for movement around a classroom, identifying individuals, or determining facial expressions due to time constraints at the hackathon.
